# Data Analyst Nanodegree
Collection of projects delivered for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

## Projects:
- **Project 1: Investigate a dataset.**
In this project we will investigate a movie database containing several details about some thousand movies.
One of the main ideas about what questions to make to this dataset is about the relationship that some
features of a movie have in the income that it produces and therefore its success.
With this idea in mind let's wrangle de dataset and let's find some hints about what makes a movie successful.

- **Project 2: Analyze A/B Test Results.**
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.
It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these.
For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.
Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page,
keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
