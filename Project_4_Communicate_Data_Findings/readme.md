# Project 4: Ford GoBike Data Analysis

## Dataset

The investigated dataset is the data provided by Ford GoBike from the year 2017 contained in a dataframe organized by biketrips. Each biketrip is described with information about the duration of the trip, and the start and end time and place. They also provide anonymized information about the users like, gender, birth year and type of user. It contains more than 500.000 trips and some of them were removed due to missing data. Finally the investigation was made in the remaining 453159 rows.


## Summary of Findings

The investigations gives relevan information about the use of the bike system by the people. So it is possible to know the moments of highest demand during the day, the week or the year. It is also possible to see information about the users like gender and age.
Finally the coordinates of the stations allow us to know about the flows of bikes and people within the cities covered by the system.

## Key Insights for Presentation

Out of the possibilities that the dataset can give, I selected to show how the use of the system changes during a normal day and within the week. Also I investigated more how the people moves within the cities and how this change between morning and afternoon.
